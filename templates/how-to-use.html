    <h1>Welcome to Quick Encounters v0.5.1</h1>
    <p>If you're seeing this message, it's because you clicked on the Quick Encounters button <img src="modules\quick-encounters\img\fist.png" alt="" width="30" height="30" /> and either:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>You didn't have any tokens selected OR</li>
    <li>You didn't have an open Journal Entry with Actor links in it</li>
    </ol>
    <p>But don't worry, we'll explain everything!</p>
    <h2>How to use Quick Encounters</h2>
    <p>Keep this Journal Entry open and follow along!</p>
    <h3>Method 1</h3>
    <p>This method duplicates the "Encounter" functionality available in <a href="fantasygrounds.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fantasy Grounds</a>.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Drag your Hostile tokens to the Scene map (either by moving existing tokens, or dragging Actors)&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Select the tokens you want to use in the Quick Encounter
    <ul>
    <li>If you want, change their visibility by right-clicking and tapping the Toggle Visibility option</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Press the&nbsp; Quick Encounters "fist" button (in the left control bar).</li>
    <li>A new Quick Encounter Journal Entry will open with Actor links representing your tokens.
    <ul>
    <li>Add descriptive text to read when you run this Encounter</li>
    <li>Pick a folder for this Journal Entry (especially if you have a folder per Scene)</li>
    <li>Notice that your tokens have disappeared off the map! Don't worry, their positions have been saved in the Journal Entry</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Close the Journal Entry and you'll see a new Note on the scene representing your Quick Encounter; you can move the Note, or double-right-click to edit its appearance.</li>
    <li>To run your Quick Encounter, double-click the Note to open the Quick Encounter Journal Entry</li>
    <li>Then click the embedded<strong> Add Quick Encounter to Combat Tracker</strong> button; all your saved tokens will be positioned on the map and added to the Combat Tracker, ready to fight! (you can also click the Quick Encounter "fist" button instead of the embedded button)</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Method 2</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Create a Journal Entry and describe your Encounter or open an existing Journal Entry (like the ones you'd find in a purchased module).</li>
    <li>Drag Actors into your Journal Entry (you can put a number in front of the Actor link to get more than one)</li>
    <li>Close the Journal Entry; if a Note doesn't already exist, one will be added to the center of your Scene view - move it to your desired Encounter location</li>
    <li>To run your Quick Encounter, double-click the Note to open the Quick Encounter Journal Entry.</li>
    <li>Click the Quick Encounter button: your generated tokens will be positioned around the Note and added to the Combat Tracker, ready to fight!
    <ul>
    <li>In this method, your tokens are always Invisible when added to the map</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>What Now?</h2>
    <p>You can just close this Journal Entry as is and it will be deleted automagically!</p>
    <p>Or you can delete all this text and turn it into your first Quick Encounter Journal Entry by following Method 2 above. Good luck!</p>
