# Description

Quick Encounters keeps your [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) map clean and your encounters simple in heavily populated dungeons. With Quick Encounters you can:
* Design your encounters by positioning and configuring Hostile tokens, then save the tokens into a Quick Encounter Journal Entry, marked with a single Map Note on the Scene which only you the DM see (similar to the Encounter ability in Fantasy Grounds). To run your Quick Encounter, simply double-click the Map Note icon and click the "Add to Combat Tracker" button; all your saved tokens will be positioned back on the map and added to the Combat Tracker, ready to fight!
* Quickly run encounters from converted or packaged modules by opening the relevant Journal Entry and pressing the Quick Encounter button - any embedded Actors are converted into tokens distributed around the corresponding Map Note, and added to the Combat Tracker
* Easily scale-up encounters by just increasing the number of Actors (change "3 Zombies" to "10 Zombies" in the Journal Entry)
* Run Roving Encounter by moving the Map Note to the desired location just before activating the encounter
* Save your player tokens at the entrance to a new Scene so you don't have to drag/move them

Quick Encounters works well with [TokenMold](https://github.com/Moerill/token-mold#token-mold) to vary your tokens names, HP, etc (although TokenMold is not required for Quick Encounters). dnd5e only: Quick Encounters also previews the XP for each group of hostiles.
