# Description

Quick Encounters keeps your [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) map clean and your encounters simple in heavily populated dungeons. Use either or both methods - you can always press the Quick Encounters button for a helpful tutorial.

**Method 1:** Drag Hostile tokens to the map and select them. Then press the Quick Encounters button and your tokens and their positions are saved into a Quick Encounter Journal Entry, and "packaged" into a single map note on the Scene. To run your Quick Encounter, simply double-click the map pin and click the "Add to Combat Tracker" button; all your saved tokens will be positioned back on the map and added to the Combat Tracker, ready to fight!

Method 1 brings the functionality of Fantasy Grounds "Encounters" to Foundry.

**Method 2:** Drag Actors into an existing or new Journal Entry describing the encounter. Then drag the Journal Entry to the Scene map at the encounter position. To run your Quick Encounter, simply double-click the map pin and click the Quick Encounter button. Your saved tokens will be positioned around the map note, and added to the Combat Tracker.

For Roving Encounters, wait to place the Quick Encounter Journal Entry until you decide on the encounter location during a session. Then follow the remaining steps for Method 2.

Quick Encounters works well with [TokenMold](https://github.com/Moerill/token-mold#token-mold) to vary your tokens names, HP, etc (although TokenMold is not required for Quick Encounters).
