BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
- Create a QE in v0.5 and make sure it mostly works in 0.6.8

USE OLD EMBEDDED METHOD
Verify above tests with Use Companion Dialog = TRUE and Use Companion Dialog = FALSE
1. Check that previously created encounters work with new Setting = TRUE
2. Check that previously created encounters work with new Setting = FALSE
3. Create a new Encounter with the "Use new Companion Dialog" = FALSE

CHECK VISIBILITY FOR A PLAYER

BUG FIXES
-  If you have two QEs open with QE dialogs, closing one Journal Entry will close both QE dialogs			OK
FIXED? v0.6.6 If you have a Journal Entry with multiple DIFFERENT mentions of the same creature, you get combinatorial multiplication of tokens etc.
