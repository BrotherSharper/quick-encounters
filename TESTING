BUG FIXES
FIXED in 0.6.3: 0.6.2: Flip the Old Embedded Setting to "Use Companion Dialog" ; add note about it becoming the default
FIXED in 0.6.3 v0.6.1: Can't change numeric field to die roll - will need to validate 
FIXED in 0.6.3b v0.6.2: XP award should be rounded in post-combat dialog
FIXED in v0.6.2: Warning about Map Note in the Journal Entry
        - move the creation of the Map Note before the render of the Journal Entry so you don't get a spurious warning
