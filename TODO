# TO DO
>>>2. If you open the Quick Encounter Journal with stored token information then use that in preference
3. Method 2 should create an embedded button and the button should be smaller (or linked to the embedded actors)
- Or maybe the Actor links are individual buttons that populate the scene instead of showing the Actors
-- Maybe shift-click shows the Actor or shift-click populates the Map
>>> 4. Sum up and show the XP (5e only) for a combat - Total XP for this Encounter Journal, and a way of calculating per # of players
<<<<<<< HEAD
5. De-select all other controlled tokens when placing tokens to add them to the combat Tracker
6. Why are we sometimes getting multiple (20?) tokens for each Actor
