# TO DO
>>>1. Example Journal Entry created with how to do it - or linked from the Settings Sheet- Or a dialog when you press the button
    - Remove the instructions after you close the Journal Entry
    - If you press the button with nothing selected, show a template Journal Entry
2. If you open the Quick Encounter Journal with stored token information then use that in preference
3. Method 2 should create an embedded button and the button should be smaller (or linked to the embedded actors)
- Or maybe the Actor links are individual buttons that populate the scene instead of showing the Actors
-- Maybe shift-click shows the Actor or shift-click populates the Map

>>> Sum up and show the XP (5e only) for a combat - Total XP for this Encounter Journal, and a way of calculating per # of players
