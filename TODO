# TO DO

## BUGS
v0.3.4 If you're on another Scene, the embedded button will switch scenes but the Quick Encounter button won't
v0.3.4 If you don't drag the Journal to the scene pressing the Quick Encounter button will fail silently
v0.3.4 If you click Quick Encounters again you get a second copy of the Tutorial
v0.4.0 If you drag tokens into the Journal Entry, later dragging new Actors will be ignored
        - should compare the Actors to the tokens and add ones that aren't represented


## FEATURES
1. Add the count x Actor to the documentation/tutorial
3. Method 2 should create an embedded button and the button should be smaller (or linked to the embedded actors)
    - Or maybe the Actor links are individual buttons that populate the scene instead of showing the Actors
    -- Maybe shift-click shows the Actor or shift-click populates the Map
>>> 4. Sum up and show the XP (5e only) for a combat - Total XP for this Encounter Journal, and a way of calculating per # of players

## FIXED BUGS
FIXED 1. If the Actor embed text includes a number that is the only number, it will be used (Rion -L14) will result in 14 copies
FIXED (v0.3.4) Sometimes the corresponding Map Note is not deleted when you delete the Journal Entry
                - This happens for Method 2 because the scene isn't recorded
FIXED (v0.3.4) 5. With Method 1, the Journal Entry is re-opened when we create the Map Note
FIXED (v0.4.0) Error in onDelete of Tutorial Journal because oneDelete->close triggers another deletion call
NOT A BUG 6. Why do we sometimes get Unknown tokens being added - seem to be left over from previous interruptions in testing
FIXED (v0.4.0) v0.3.4 If you drag additional Actors to the Journal Entry, they are not getting added

## COMPLETED FEATURES
DONE: (v0.4.0): If your on a different scene, pops a dialog to check that you want to switch scenes
DONE v0.3.4: De-select all other controlled tokens when placing tokens to add them to the combat Tracker
DONE (v0.4.0) Replace forEach calls with for/of
DONE 2. If you open the Quick Encounter Journal with stored token information then use that in preference
DONE - Finish i18n for dialogs (but not for tutorial Journal)
