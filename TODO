# TO DO

## BUGS
FIXED 1. If the Actor embed text includes a number that is the only number, it will be used (Rion -L14) will result in 14 copies
FIXED (v0.3.4) Sometimes the corresponding Map Note is not deleted when you delete the Journal Entry
                - This happens for Method 2 because the scene isn't recorded
4. If you don't drag the Journal to the scene pressing the Quick Encounter button will fail silently
FIXED (v0.3.4) 5. With Method 1, the Journal Entry is re-opened when we create the Map Note

## FEATURES
1. Add the count x Actor to the documentation/tutorial
>>>2. If you open the Quick Encounter Journal with stored token information then use that in preference
    - May already be true
3. Method 2 should create an embedded button and the button should be smaller (or linked to the embedded actors)
    - Or maybe the Actor links are individual buttons that populate the scene instead of showing the Actors
    -- Maybe shift-click shows the Actor or shift-click populates the Map
>>> 4. Sum up and show the XP (5e only) for a combat - Total XP for this Encounter Journal, and a way of calculating per # of players
v0.3.4: De-select all other controlled tokens when placing tokens to add them to the combat Tracker
6. Why do we sometimes get Unknown tokens being added
