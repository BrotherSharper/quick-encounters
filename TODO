# TO DO

## BUGS
v0.6: Can't copy a QE Journal Entry - it references the old QE
v0.6.8: You can use a Compendium link - but the Image doesn't always appear in the QE dialog
        - use the lazy loading method from Compendiums?
           
## FEATURES
- Add a link back to the README
- Add to the README FAQs about handling multiple instances
>>> Add the QE button to the JE border to reopen the dialog
    - add to the window border of the QE dialog    

### Version 0.7
- Remove the option to not use the QE dialog (including Setting and direction at the bottom of the QE dialog)
- Refactor how we're handling token allocation: creation or addition
    - should always maintain an accurate generated tokens, incorporating saved tokens
    - combine "combineTokens" and "generate" (they are always used together)
    - other refactoring (see below)
- Save token positions for Compendium actors and allow deleting the Actors  
    - remember that you dragged the Compendium link to the Scene before capturing it in Method 1
- Option to leave the tokens on the Scene (invisible or visible) but:
    - turn them visible when you press the Quick Encounters button
    - When the Companion dialog opens - show the token position as TEMPORARY tokens on the map - allow them to be moved or deleted    
    - add them to the Combat Tracker
    - when you're on the entry in the QE dialog it should show the positions of those tokens
    - maybe an option to place all the tokens and move them around, then they get automatically captured and removed
- Allow tokens to be dragged over the specific Group/Wave/Actor
- Allow tiles to be saved in the same way as tokens (from Issues)
- Include a Playlists or track to play when combat starts    
- Synchronize with the Journal Entry if there are Actor links
- Add the QE button to the window border of the Companion Dialog
- Create multiple QEs (Waves/Adds) per Journal Entry
- Use QE. constants to keep the namespace clean
- Ability to copy an Encounter (if you copy the Journal Entry) - should move any placed tokens to the new Map Note

- If you drag a Journal Entry to the Scene, then intercept to change the icon etc.
    - Partially done: could identify it's a Quick Encounter from the inclusion of Actor links
        but perhaps a better approach would be with a flag that was set

- XP to award dialog should have checkboxes for who awards XP and who gets it
    - create a separate module from this 

### Later
More sophisticated monster entries:
    - Scan Journal Entries to turn into Actor links and Quick Encounters
    - Allow dynamic generation of which monsters (use a RollTable?)

- Show which Journal Entries have Quick Encounters in the Journal list

- Editing Companion dialog
    - Or JE-by-JE option to use new method; or global option   
        - Sync methods: Manual, JE-to-Companion, Companion-to-JE

## REFACTORING
- Refactor EncounterCompanionDialog to QuickEncounterDialog
- Remove unused styles from .css
- addTokens: Could just add the tokens one by one rather than filtering etc.
    - Need to refactor so we use a constructor or factory rather than setting individual instance parameters outside the class
- Improve the way the Journal Entry gets built to do more with the template and handlebars

## DOCS





## FIXED BUGS
FIXED 1. If the Actor embed text includes a number that is the only number, it will be used (Rion -L14) will result in 14 copies
FIXED (v0.3.4) Sometimes the corresponding Map Note is not deleted when you delete the Journal Entry
                - This happens for Method 2 because the scene isn't recorded
FIXED (v0.3.4) 5. With Method 1, the Journal Entry is re-opened when we create the Map Note
FIXED (v0.4.0) Error in onDelete of Tutorial Journal because oneDelete->close triggers another deletion call
NOT A BUG 6. Why do we sometimes get Unknown tokens being added - seem to be left over from previous interruptions in testing
FIXED (v0.4.0) v0.3.4 If you drag additional Actors to the Journal Entry, they are not getting added
FIXED (v0.4.0) v0.3.4 If you're on another Scene, the embedded button will switch scenes but the Quick Encounter button won't
FIXED (v0.4.1) v0.4.0 Method 2 isn't creating a Map Note - EncounterNote.place needs to place a Note or ask you to do that if one does not exist
FIXED (v0.4.1) v0.3.4 If you don't drag the Journal to the scene pressing the Quick Encounter button will fail silently
FIXED (v0.4.2) 0.4.1 If the number of Actors is part of a sentence, it won't be picked up correctly
FIXED (v0.4.2) 0.4.1 If you have a Player selected when you open your Quick Encounter, it will create a new one instead
            - Fixed: Ignore Friendly tokens
FIXED (v0.4.2) 0.4.1 Was using Dialog.prompt which doesn't exist in 0.6.6 - replaced with local implementation
FIXED (v0.5.0) 0.4.3 Saved tokens should bypass Token Mold
FIXED (v0.5.0) v0.3.4 If you click Quick Encounters again you get a second copy of the Tutorial
FIXED (v0.5.0) 0.4.3   Switch Scene still not working properly (qeScene.view() needs to wait until finished)
NOT A BUG  0.4.0   The TurnMarker app is throwing errors - are those related to 0.7.2 or in 0.6.6
        - Doesn't seem to be happening in 0.6.6
FIXED (v0.5.0) 0.5.0 Token.create() was returning a single token if you passed in a single-element array of token data; fixed to check
    - (would mean single-opponent encounters wouldn't be added to the Combat Tracker)
FIXED (v0.5.0) v0.4.0 If you drag tokens into the Journal Entry, later adding new Actors will be ignored
FIXED (v0.5.3) v0.5.2 If you have the Tutorial Journal Entry open and try to save a Journal Entry and then close it, it will delete the Journal ENTRY
            - because it's searching the WHOLE DOM for QuickEncountersTutorial, not just the particular Journal SHeet being closed
FIXED (v0.5.3)  If you press the Quick Encounters button in a QE Journal, get another instance of the button;
                    - needs to check that the button and Div isn't already there
                    - was this happening in 0.6.6? No
                    - Delete any existing dynamic QE sections and re-create them
FIXED? in 0.6.0: v0.5.0 Sometimes the Combat Tracker is not ready in time - need to increase the timeout and maybe check if it's been rendered
                        - happens when the image is not local but an http link
FIXED in 0.6.0b: v0.5.4: Should check for QE.HowToUse.TITLE in deciding whether to pop up an extra Tutorial
FIXED in 0.6.1 The XP to award dialog box no longer shows for everyone when you delete the Combat Tracker 
        - won't work because once there is a Quick Encounter you can't get rid of it 
FIXED in 0.6.1: If you 0 out all Actors then remove the Quick Encounter completely 
FIXED in v0.6.1 Intro Je is no longer accurate with Companion Dialog method
FIXED in 0.6.2: Scene not being saved or displayed
FIXED in 0.6.2:  Note not being created - coords werent being saved
FIXED in 0.6.3: 0.6.2: Flip the Old Embedded Setting to "Use Companion Dialog" ; add note about it becoming the default
FIXED in 0.6.3 v0.6.1: Can't change numeric field to die roll - will need to validate 
FIXED in 0.6.3b v0.6.2: XP award should be rounded in post-combat dialog
FIXED in v0.6.2: Warning about Map Note in the Journal Entry
        - move the creation of the Map Note before the render of the Journal Entry so you don't get a spurious warning
FIXED in v0.6.4: With no embedded Actors, the Companion dialog wasn't closing when all Actors were removed
FIXED in v0.6.4: Previouly you would get repeats of the actor if you added tokens for the first Actor
CAN'T REPRODUCE in 0.6.4: v0.6.2: token.update and token.create could both fail if the data is missing - provide friendlier information for user    
                -   Getting  token.create errors with Required field name on generated tokens
CAN'T REPRODUCE: v0.6.4: If you make multiple changes to Actors (more than one line) get an array of numActors back
FIXED in v0.6.4:  Saved tokens were being removed when you switched to a die-roll to generate; now shows slots forup to the max of the die roll
CAN'T REPROODUCE: v0.5.3 In Foundry 0.7.3, doesn't create saved tokens correctly if they were made from a non-standard Actor
CAN'T REPRODUCE v0.6.5: Test generating a Quick Encounter by dragging Actors into the Journal Entry; seems to store them but also reset
FIXED in 0.6.7: 0.6.6: Wildcard Randomization doesn't work when placing tokens using Method 2
FIXED in 0.6.7: 0.6: Compendium links don't work
FIXED in 0.6.8: v0.6.6: If you have two identical Actors in the QE dialog, the formdata combines them into one row    
WON'T FIX: v0.5.0 You still see and hear HP rolling with Token Mold, even though the saved tokens are not changed
                    - there are now features in TokenMold and other mods to prevent this
FIXED v0.6.6 If you have a Journal Entry with multiple DIFFERENT mentions of the same creature, you get combinatorial multiplication of tokens etc.
        - when you place tokens, add them to the first instance, then subsequent instances, then back to the first
FIXED v0.6.6: If you have two identical Actors in the QE dialog, the formdata combines them into one row 
        - so instead we need to add a row# to distinguish  
FIXED in 0.6.9: v0.6.6 If you have two QEs open with QE dialogs, closing one Journal Entry will close both QE dialogs
        - it looks like you can't have two QE dialogs open simulataneously; one replaces the other
